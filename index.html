				<h3>Development</h3>
				<div class="work-content development">
					<p>The main languages I work in are PHP, Python and Javascript. For code exmples see <a href="https://github.com/LewisMcMahon">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~lewismcmahon">NPM</a></p>

					<h4>PHP</h4>
					<p>I started using php in 2008 when I built my first website and once someone found out I could do websites I quickly ended up doing freelance work. Over the years I have built many websites and applications including gallery, custom event booking software, a system to automate generate print ready pfd’s for business cards, I advised the development team on a new online lottery site and many others.</p>
					<p>My main specialty with php is security and implementing login systems using things like unique user salts, multi factor auth and authentication hashes.</p>

					<h4>Python</h4>
					<p>I have been using python since 2013 for web crawling and general data analysis along with general devops scripting.</p>
					<p>I mostly write 2.7 but have started to use 3.x in the last few years.</p>

					<h4>Javascript</h4>
					<p>I have been using jquery and javascript since i started doing web design and develpment in 2008 but in recent years i have started to use NodeJS more and more and now maintain several plugins for the NodeBB project.</p>

				<h3>AWS</h3>
				<div class="work-content aws">
					<p>I have been a user of Amazon Web Services since 2011 initially just using EC2 but I now I have several projects using EC2, SES, S3, ECS, RDS, Route 53, Lambda and CloudWatch.</p>
					<p>I have migrated several company's to AWS from traditional hosting, where we used things like custom CloudWatch metrics and S3 to cut their bills in half along with giving them more redundancy, fault tolerance and faster disaster recovery. Several of those migrations also included migration users from SVN to git and implementing a proper deployment pipeline such as AWS CodeDeploy, DeployHQ and Rocketeer.</p>

				<h3>Climbing</h3>
				<div class="work-content climbing">
					<p>I am an adventure climber for me the experience of climbing a spicy traditional route has so much more value than climbing a hard sport route. I climb mostly in and around the peak district but have my eyes on a few projects in the lakes this year and possibly one in scotland.</p>
					<p>I am currently undertaking a Summer Mountain leader course, with a view to taking a Mountaineering Instructor Award course next year. This is mostly to broaden my skillset and give me some more confidence to take people on larger multi-pitch climbs</p>
